This project aims to explore the development and implementation of an IoT-based food ordering 
system, designed to revolutionize the dining experience for both customers and restaurant staff.
The proposed system entails the installation of touch screen displays on restaurant tables, enabling 
patrons to interact directly with the menu and place orders seamlessly. Leveraging IoT technology, 
these displays are connected to a central server that integrates with the restaurant's inventory 
management and kitchen operations software. Through the intuitive interface of the touch screen 
displays, customers can browse through the menu, view detailed descriptions and images of dishes, 
customize their orders, and even make special requests or dietary accommodations
